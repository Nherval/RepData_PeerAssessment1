```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data

```{r load-data}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
```

## Total Number of Steps Taken per Day 

```{r total-steps}
library(ggplot2)
total_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum, na.rm = TRUE)

#Histogram 

ggplot(total_steps, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day", x = "Total Steps per Day", y = "Frequency")

#Mean and Median 
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps$steps)
median_steps <- median(total_steps$steps)
mean_steps
median_steps
```

##Average Daily Activity Pattern

```{r daily-patern}
avg_steps_interval <- aggregate (steps~interval, data, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

#Time Series Plot 
plot(avg_steps_interval$interval, avg_steps_interval$steps, type = "l", xlab = "5- Minute Interval", ylab = "Average Steps", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern")

#Interval with Maximum Steps 
max_interval <- avg_steps_interval[which.max(avg_steps_interval$steps),]
max_interval
```

## Imputing Missing Values 

```{r impute-missing}
missing_values <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
missing_values

#Imputation using mean per interval 
data_imputed <- data
data_imputed$steps[is.na(data_imputed$steps)] <- ave(data$steps, data$interval, FUN = function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))[is.na(data$steps)]

#Histogram After Imputation 
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps~date, data_imputed, sum)
ggplot(total_steps_imputed, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "green", alpha = 0.7) + labs (title = "Histogram After Imputation", x = "Total Steps per Day", y = "Frecuency")

#Mean and Median After Imputation 
mean_steps_imputed <- mean (total_steps_imputed$steps)
median_steps_imputed <- median(total_steps_imputed$steps)
mean_steps_imputed
median_steps_imputed
```

##Activity Patterns: Weekday vs. Weekend 
```{r weekday-weekend}
data_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(weekdays(data_imputed$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")

avg_steps_week <- aggregate(steps ~interval + day_type, data_imputed, mean)

ggplot(avg_steps_week, aes(x=interval, y = steps, color = day_type)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~day_type, ncol = 1) + labs (title = "Activity Patterns: Weekday vs. Weekend", x = "Interval", y = "Average")
